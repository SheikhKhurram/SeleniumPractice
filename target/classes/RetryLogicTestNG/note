IRetry logic used to execute the failed testcases again 

We can achieve this at test level or at runtime 

Runtime is recomended 

At testLevel 
	Create testclass 
		In this set @Test(retryAnalizer = className)
	Create retry class 
		Create another class which implements IRetryAnalyzer and override "retry(ITestResult result)" method


At runtime 
	Create testclass 
		It's normal testcases 
	Create retry class 
		As mentioned above 
	Create transform class 
		transform class implements IAnnotationTransformer and override the method transform method 
		and call using annotation reference variable annotation.setRetryAnalyzer(call the retryclass)
